## Special thanks to...

* ShadowMario and Co. for [Psych engine](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine)

* Nebula_Zorua for the [specific Psych fork](https://github.com/nebulazorua/exe-psych-fork) NMV is built off and for the Modchart backend

* Rozebud for the chart editor little buddies ([Check out their engine too](https://github.com/ThatRozebudDude/FPS-Plus-Public))

## How to compile NMV Engine

### Download the prerequisites... (skip this if you already have compiled any fnf project, or any flixel project basically lol)

[Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/)

[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

[VS Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)

within the VS Community Installer, download `Desktop development with c++`

### Download the projects required libraries...

In a cmd within the project directory, in order run...

> haxelib install hxpkg

> haxelib run hxpkg setup

> haxelib run hxpkg install

### Quick Note
- Haxe 4.3.6 or newer is expected
- This engine ENFORCES the use of local libraries with hxpkg/hmm to prevent issues in relation to `hxvlc`
- The recommended library versions are listed within the .hxpkg file.


After that is complete, run `lime test windows` and you should be compiling
